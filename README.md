# TDA notebooks
This folder contains 3 notebooks (Image_TDA, Text_TDA and Directed_graph_TDA) and helper files to run them.

* **Image_TDA:** computes descriptors for a given image.
* **Text_TDA:** investigates the textual information of product descriptions, then it computes descriptors for the graph the vectors from word2vec form, using cosine distance. It also computes it with chunks. It computes TF-IDF of the given text.
* **Directed_graph_TDA:** computes descriptors for directed graph and how to drop the nodes that modify the descriptors less.
