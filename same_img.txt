{"asin": "B0018ZKDA8", "description": "Hare & Tortoise is a uniquely original race game in that movement is governed by skill rather than chance. Instead of rolling dice to find out how far to move, you can always move forwards as far as you like - but only if you can afford to pay for it. This you do by consuming units of energy called carrots. The 65 carrots you start with are just enough to get you home one square at a time by spending one carrot per move. Alternatively, they are enough to get you up to ten squares forward in a single leap, and you can earn more by carefully choosing which square to land on.\n\nBut there's a catch!\n\nThe catch is that the further you move in one turn, the faster the cost of moving accelerates. Therefore -\n\n    * If you play like a hare, taking great leaps forward at each move, you risk running out of carrots so fast that you may lose valuable time trying to get them back. But:\n    * If you play like a tortoise, plodding along as cheaply as possible, you risk lagging so far behind that you may never have time to catch up with the others.\n\nThe skill of the game lies in choosing which square to move to, and deciding whether to play hare-wise or tortoise-wise depending on your position. The fun of the game lies in changing other runner's positions by overtaking them - or even undertaking them by moving backwards.\n\nSo, unlike traditional race games, Hare & Tortoise is won by superior strategy and player interaction. The element of chance is not only reduced to a minimum, but can be eliminated altogether by agreeing to avoid landing on Hare squares, which are, by design, the only external chance elements in the game.", "title": "Hase und Igel", "price": 38.56, "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "salesRank": {"Toys & Games": 829386}, "categories": [["Musical Instruments", "Wind & Woodwind Instruments", "Folk & World", "Mouth Harps"]]}
